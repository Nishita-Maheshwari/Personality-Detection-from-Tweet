Personality is an important parameter as it differentiates various individuals from one another. Personality prediction is an 
evergreen area of research. Predicting personality with the help of data through social media is a promising approach as this
method does not require any questionnaires to be filled by users thus reducing time and increasing credibility. Thus having
knowledge of personality is an interesting domain for researchers to work on. Predicting personality has many applications in
real world. Use of social media is increasing day by day. Huge amount of textual data as well as images continue to explode to
the web daily.Current work focuses on Linear Discriminate Analysis, Multinomial Naive Bayes and AdaBoost over Twitter standard
